Hi! I am Terry Pei ðŸ˜Š, a researcher at the University of Sydney. I major in deep learning at the school of computer science.

**Research Field**: Data-centric deep learning. I also have rich experience on NLP and CV during the industry internship.

**Recent Work**: Update the AI search engine to automatic annotator via GPT models.
