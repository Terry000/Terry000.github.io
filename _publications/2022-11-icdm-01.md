excerpt: 'We a hierarchical multi-stage architecture for simulating the cognitive diagnosis in the latent space. The attention mechanism extracts the similarity of the examinee, quiz and knowledge points and the gate mechanism patterns the noisy information in a higher-dimensional embedding space. Our proposed model enhances the performance both on prediction scores and interpretability for cognitive reasons. Furthermore, we deployed our model on the meta-learning framework to address the cold-start problems on new datasets at the initial training stage.'
