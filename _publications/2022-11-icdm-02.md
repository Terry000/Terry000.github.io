excerpt: 'Here we introduce an approach to solve various downstream tasks by pre-training the multi-representation features on both programming and natural syntax. The model encodes the code syntax and natural language description (comment) by two encoders and the encoded embeddings are projected into a multi-modal space for learning the latent representation. In the latent space, C3P jointly trains the code and comment encoders by the symmetric loss function, which aims to maximize the cosine similarity of the correct code-comment pairs while minimizing the similarity of unrelated pairs.'
