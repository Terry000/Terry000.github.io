excerpt: 'The task of annotating complex structured data, such as graphs, into concise sum- maries poses a significant challenge across various domains, frequently requiring the allocation of significant time and specialized knowledge by human experts. In this work, we propose a generating-recovering annotation approach that leverages the one-shot learning capabilities of the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) models. The proposed approach comprises a one-shot tuning phase followed by a generation phase.'
