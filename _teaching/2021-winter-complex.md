Worked as a teaching tutor for a the graduate course on deep learning, with the content of basic regression/classification, optimizer, cnn, transformer, vit, GPT.
Held weekly tutorial sections on programming (using Python, pytorch). Provided support on development technologies including Git, Restructured Text markup, and Jupyter Labs (Colab Pro) to students. And I demonstrated details of each code block about how to design and build task-oriented neural networks.
